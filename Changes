	* Correct mistake that prevented PAUSE indexing

1.144 2021-01-13T09:21:42Z
	* No code changes, but distro freshening, losing Travis CI
	* Added GitHub Actions
	* Fixed a problem with output files from the .PL
	* This now tries to make the right module file for pre-v5.20
	and post v5.20 to handle the new :prototype attribute. So, the
	module changes itself for the version of Perl that installs
	it. See also Preparing for Perl 7: https://leanpub.com/preparing_for_perl7
